<p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through compliance with this privacy policy (the "Policy"). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide in the Origin Ireland mobile application (the "Mobile Application" or "App") and any related services (collectively, the "Services"). It outlines our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing this information.</p>

<p>This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "you" or "your") and the Mobile Application developer ("Operator", "we", "us" or "our"). By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree, you must not use the App.</p>

<h2 id="information-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We may process only minimal user data, limited to what is necessary to provide the Mobile Application and Services. This includes:</p>

<h3>Location Data:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Approximate Location</strong>: We collect this data to show nearby historical sites and provide location-based services.</li>
  <li><strong>Precise Location</strong>: We collect this data to provide detailed site recommendations and enable features such as Discover Mode and Plan Journey.</li>
</ul>
<p>Location data is shared only with third-party services (e.g., Google Maps) to provide navigation and similar functionality.</p>

<h3>Camera Access:</h3>
<p>We request access to your device’s camera only with your explicit consent. This is used for augmented reality features (e.g., Try Origin AR).</p>

<h3>Photos and Media:</h3>
<p>The app includes a history diary feature where users can save photos locally. These photos are not collected, shared, or transmitted by us.</p>

<p>We do not collect any personal information unless necessary for core functionalities of the App, and we never share or sell user data.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-use-data">2. How We Use Collected Information</h2>
<p>We use the collected data solely for functionality and improving the App. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>App Functionality</strong>: To show nearby historical sites, provide site information, and allow users to plan journeys.</li>
  <li><strong>Discover Mode</strong>: To notify users of nearby historical sites based on location, including background location access (if permission is granted).</li>
  <li><strong>Plan Journey</strong>: To send the user's location to Google Maps for directions.</li>
</ul>
<p>No personal data or media are accessed beyond what is required for these functionalities.</p>

<h2 id="permissions">3. Permissions We Use and Why</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>INTERNET</strong>: Used to retrieve images of historical sites from an Amazon S3 server and access Google Maps for the Plan Journey feature.</li>
  <li><strong>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION & ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</strong>: Required to provide location-based features such as Discover Mode and Plan Journey.</li>
  <li><strong>ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION</strong>: Used for Discover Mode, allowing the app to notify users of nearby sites when running in the background.</li>
  <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS</strong>: Sends notifications when users are near historical sites (with explicit permission).</li>
  <li><strong>FOREGROUND_SERVICE</strong>: Supports Discover Mode by allowing background services to run.</li>
  <li><strong>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE & WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</strong>: Allows users to save photos to their device (locally) for the History Diary.</li>
  <li><strong>CAMERA</strong>: Required for the Try Origin AR feature, allowing users to view AR content.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="disclosure-of-information">4. Disclosure of Information</h2>
<p>We may share your data with third-party service providers such as Google Maps, but only to provide core functionalities like navigation. These providers are bound by their own privacy policies. We do not share, sell, or trade your personal data for marketing or other purposes.</p>

<p>Service Providers are given access to data only as needed to perform services and are not authorized to use your information beyond the purposes we have specified.</p>

<h2 id="data-security">5. Data Security</h2>
<p>We secure the information you provide in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no data transmission over the internet or mobile network can be guaranteed as 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, you acknowledge that there are security limitations of the internet, and you use the App at your own risk.</p>

<h2 id="retention-of-information">6. Retention of Information</h2>
<p>We retain data only as long as necessary for the services provided. Any data shared (e.g., with Google Maps for navigation) is processed temporarily and not stored by us. Once the retention period expires, any personal information (if applicable) will be deleted.</p>

<h2 id="data-analytics">7. Data Analytics</h2>
<p>The Mobile Application may use third-party analytics tools to collect standard activity information such as usage statistics and session data. This information helps us improve the app’s performance but does not include any personally identifiable information.</p>

<h2 id="links-to-other-resources">8. Links to Other Resources</h2>
<p>The App may contain links to external resources not controlled by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external resources, and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.</p>

<h2 id="data-breach">9. Data Breach</h2>
<p>If we become aware of a security breach resulting in the disclosure of user data, we will take appropriate measures, including notifying affected users and cooperating with law enforcement if necessary.</p>

<h2 id="changes-and-amendments">10. Changes and Amendments</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time. Changes will be effective once posted within the App. By continuing to use the App after changes are posted, you consent to the updated Policy.</p>

<h2 id="acceptance-of-this-policy">11. Acceptance of this Policy</h2>
